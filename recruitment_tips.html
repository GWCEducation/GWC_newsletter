								<p>Let’s face it, student recruitment is one of the main contributing factors to the success of your Girls Who Code Club! If you have found yourself struggling to recruit more members, or can’t figure out how to recruit girls who are most interested in code and sisterhood, you are not alone! We have put together some tips from Facilitators who have been thinking outside the box and we are excited to share what has worked for them!</p>
										
								<h5>Resources on HQ</h5>
								
								<p>Start with checking out the Student Recruitment Resources in the Facilitator Toolkit on HQ. Girls Who Code has provided some helpful tips and tricks along with an informational slide deck all about Girls Who Code. Feel free to make a copy of these slides to use at an informational meeting or kick-off session.</p>
							
								<h5>Social media</h5>
								
								<p>Many Clubs report that they have had a lot of success working with area schools to publicize their Clubs on Social Media. You can utilize the resources in the Girls Who Code Media Kit to put together engaging posts complete with pictures, logos, and even video!</p>
								
								<h5>Digital displays</h5>
								
								<p>Does a school or library near you make use of digital displays? Find out how you can get an advertisement for your Club included in these types of displays. Many places will let you submit a slide that they can include in the scrolling presentation. It's a great way to visually appeal to girls who are interested in getting involved. You are welcome to use slides from the slide deck mentioned above or media from the Media Kit to create your advertisement.</p>
								
								<h5>Personal invitations</h5>
								
								<p>Reach out to teachers in the area and ask them to nominate students who they feel would be interested in Girls Who Code. Send out personalized invitations to those girls. It's amazing how special they will feel when they receive a personal note detailing how they were nominated by one of their teachers!</p>
								
								<h5>The more the merrier</h5>
								
								<p>Invite interested members to bring a friend to your informational session or kick-off meeting. If everyone brings one friend you could potentially double your enrollment! The chances of retaining those numbers are always higher when girls feel they have a partner in the mix.</p>
								
								<h5>Go where the action is</h5>
								
								<p>Find out what types of events at area schools bring in most parents. Is there a Curriculum Night or an Open House coming up? Maybe a Science or STEM night? Find out if you can set up a booth so you can share information with parents face-to-face. Bring some flyers to pass out and think about sharing the slide deck or videos on a loop at the table. Be ready to chat with girls at the school who are interested in taking on Computer Science as a career and those who are just curious about the Club. A little sisterhood will go a long way!</p>
								
								<p>Hopefully, these tips and tricks will inspire you to recruit more members to your Club. If you have more ideas to share, we would love to hear them! If you have questions or still need more tips, email your Club Success Specialist to get the conversation going.</p>
